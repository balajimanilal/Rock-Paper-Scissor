# Rock-Paper-Scissor
Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors repo! ðŸŽ® This is a simple Python implementation of the classic game where players compete against the computer. The program determines the winner based on traditional rules. It's a great project for beginners to practice control structures and user interaction in Python!

# Features
* User Input: Players can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by entering a corresponding number.
* Computer Opponent: The computer randomly selects its choice, providing a fun challenge.
* Game Logic: The program determines the winner based on the rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
